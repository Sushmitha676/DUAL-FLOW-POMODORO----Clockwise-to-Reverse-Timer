# DUAL-FLOW-POMODORO----Clockwise-to-Reverse-Timer

# Overview
The DUAL-FLOW POMODORO is a productivity-enhancing Pomodoro timer that introduces a "clockwise-to-reverse" countdown technique. Unlike traditional Pomodoro timers, which count down from 25 minutes, this timer initially counts up (clockwise) from 00:00 to 25:00 and then counts down (reverse) from 25:00 to 00:00. This unique approach is designed to help procrastinators stay engaged and prevent distractions after breaks by reinforcing their work momentum.

The timer follows this structured cycle:

1] **Work Session**: (00:00 to 25:00) → Clockwise counting.                                     
2] **Short Break**: (00:00 to 05:00) → Clockwise counting.                                      
3] **Work Session**: (25:00 to 00:00) → Reverse counting.                                       
4] **Long Break**: (00:00 to 10:00) → Clockwise counting.                                       
5] **Repeat** for 'n' sessions without a visible repetitive pattern.

✅ User-Friendly GUI – Simple, intuitive design with clear time progress indicators.           
✅ Custom ‘n’ Sessions Cycle – Runs indefinitely in a unique, non-repetitive sequence, avoiding predictability.                                                                        

# 💡 Why It's Useful?                                                                          
🔹 Overcomes Procrastination – The reverse timer psychologically encourages users to complete tasks rather than quit after breaks.                                                            
🔹 Maintains Work Momentum – Unlike traditional Pomodoro timers, this approach prevents loss of motivation after a break.                                                                   
🔹 Enhances Time Awareness – The switching timer flow makes users more mindful of their time and effort.                                                                                     
🔹 Customizable & Flexible – Works for different productivity styles, whether short tasks or deep work sessions.                                                                             
🔹 Efficient for Long Study/Work Sessions – Balances work and break times in an optimized cycle.                                                                                          

# 🛠️ How to Use It?                                                                            
1] **Start the Timer** – Click the 'Start' button, and the work session will begin counting clockwise (00:00 → 25:00).                                                                      
2] **Short Break** – After the first work session, the short break timer runs clockwise (00:00 → 05:00).                                                                                       
3] **Reverse Work Session** – The next work session counts backwards (25:00 → 00:00).           
4] **Long Break** – After two work cycles, a long break (00:00 → 10:00) follows.                
5] **Repeating the Cycle** – The pattern continues dynamically without visible repetition.
